                <h3>Helpful Hearth</h3>
                <p>At Julia's, we're not just about threads – we're about
                    spreading love, too! Partnering with a local charity, we
                    groove together to fill empty tables for the homeless. Our
                    commitment goes beyond just partnering; we organize a
                    multitude of upcoming cloth and food drives, each an
                    invitation to join the rhythm of giving. Check our calendar
                    to sync up with the vibes of our next drive and be a part of
                    the movement, where community and compassion collide in a
                    symphony of generosity!
                    <br> See when our next drive is over on our calendar: </p>

                <h3>Greenwich Education Society</h3>
                <p>Julia and the G.E.S have been inseparable since the groovy
                    days of 2016, vibing together to teach the young generation,
                    aged 12 to 18, the true beauty of upcycling. We're not just
                    mending clothes; we're preventing an excess of material
                    waste and helping young adults build skills that will make
                    them more independent. It's a journey of creativity,
                    sustainability, and empowerment. Join us in stitching the
                    fabric of a brighter future, one thread at a time! <br>
